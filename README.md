A demo for NAudio &amp; SoundTouch

This is a simple audio-palyer demo.   
This demo is a simplification of Practice#. I rewrote it in C# & WPF.  
In this demo, I use NAudio to play file, and use SoundTouch so stretch file.

I love to share experience in coding with anyone. 
Although My mother language is not English, I would try my best to express my idea.
